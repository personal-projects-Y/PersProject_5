This project involves building a Java based inventory management system for water purification units using a menu driven text interface. The program tracks individual units by serial number and model, records test results and shipping dates, loads data from JSON files, and generates sorted reports for operational decision-making. The focus is on managing structured data, validating critical identifiers, producing clear reports, and maintaining a clean separation between the data model and user interface.
